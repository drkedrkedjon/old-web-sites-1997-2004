        go to Las Palmas. Better check for address before you leave your country.

          <br>
          After the island had emerged from the ocean birds are first living creatures 
          that came on this isolated and deserted island. Carried by the wind 
          the seafaring birds build their nests or rested here, Different natural 
          mechanisms were to influence the islands vegetation. Some seeds have 
          been carried by birds. <br>
          <br>
          Another way for the seeds to get to the Canaries is by fruits that floated 
          and ended on island shores. Normally most of the seeds are lost however 
          island has been today cowered with plants from different parts of the 
          world. <br>
          <br>
          The oldest plants are the "verodes" and "tajinastes". Dragon trees and 
          milk thistles are the second oldest, originating in east and south Africa. 
          Laurel barbuzano till, can still be found. The Canarian pine tree, that 
          arrived in Gran Canaria at the end of the tertiary age is according 
          to botanists also found in the Himalayas. Canarian laurels arrived island 
          at the end of the tertiary age. <br>
          <br>
          Due to the excellent climatic conditions it found here this vegetation 
          has remained unchanged whilst in the places it originated in, it was 
          transformed or lost forever Agave. Escobones and retamas (types of plant) 
          grow around the medium heights and peaks, by the forests of pinus canariensis. 
          They arrived on Gran Canaria through the Atlas Mountains. From the Mediterranean. 
          Gorse and tarajales are two of the plants that appeared recently. Which 
          originated in the Sahara. The different varieties of mint whose aromatic 
          and medicinal leaves are so pleasant, come from southern Africa and 
          South America whose closest relative is a herb found in the Himalayas 
          and western China. There is 242 plants which are endemic to Gran Canaria, 
          and are considered unique in the world. <br>
          <br>
          The animal population here is a quite mystery. Animals arrived here 
          either blown by the wind, flying by their own means, or using vegetation 
          as rafts. Insects, birds and bats form part of the first and second 
          groups. The last group covers animals brought by man and includes the 
          green frog from south east Europe and north Africa, currently in danger 
          of extinction. The lizard world is of particular interest in the Canary 
          Islands. One of the species. According to fossil remains found on the 
          western islands is 1 0 million years old The lizards living today are 
          between 0.50 and 0.60 meters in length but can measure up to one meter. 
          They are not dangerous, only eating plants. The bird world is represented 
          by 61 nesting species. However, many others are migratory, stopping 
          here regularly on their journey to other lands or spending the winter 
          here. A third group of birds is made up of those who are rare or occasional 
          visitors to the islands. One of their favorite places to stop and break 
          up was the Charca de Maspalomas. Even today you can still spot many 
          of them on this comfortable aquatic orchard. <br>
