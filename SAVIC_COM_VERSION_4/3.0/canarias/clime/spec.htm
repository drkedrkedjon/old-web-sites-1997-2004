        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T</font></font>here is few canarian specialities when 
        We talk about clime. First is wind that comes from influence of anticyclone 
        in Azores. It is always present, in same direction and in constant power, 
        depending on season, that make this island &quot;the place&quot; for windsurfing. 
        Of course wind is more important for local people, because it brings heavy 
        humidity from Atlantic ocean. <br>
        <font size="+3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H</font>umidity, pushed by wind in upper 
        levels of island mountains, fall on land in form of &quot;horizontal rain&quot;. 
        This is second speciality of canarias. Horizontal rain is mostly present 
        in autumn and winter and mostly in north of island. Sometimes when anticyclone 
        goes more on south it bring cold weather and normally raining.<br>
        <font size="+3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W</font>hen anticyclone goes more on 
        north it brings &quot;Shiroco&quot;, nasty wind from Sahara with sand 
        and no humidity at all. It brings temperature in upper 40. This is next 
        speciality.<br>
        </b><font size="+3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</b></font><b>nd maybe the last 
        speciality is diversity of clime in one island. You can drive around island 
        in one day and change all weathers situation in few hours. You will catch 
        warm rain in north, fog and snow in mountains and sunny beaches in south.
