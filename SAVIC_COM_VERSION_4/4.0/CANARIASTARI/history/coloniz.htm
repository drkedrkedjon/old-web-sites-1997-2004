  <h2><font size="+1">Knowledge about Canarias...</font> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;First knowledge about Canarias came in accent age. Even Romans 
    speak about archipelago. We can read about it in works of Homero, Plinio. 
    etc. On the opposite side Europeans until 14th. century seems have no knowledge 
    about islands. They came under spot after roads to orient has closed for reasons 
    of Muslim occupation. <br>

    <br>
    <font size="+1">Conquest...</font> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The process begins in 1402, with Lanzarote and ended in 1496, 
    with Tenerife. There were two levels. One called &quot;se&ntilde;orial&quot;, 
    and second &quot;realenga&quot;. First is made by Juan de Bethencourt, with 
    beck up in private &amp; business money. He take Lanzarote in 1402, Fuerteventura 
    in 1405, and also La Gomera and El Hierro. Second is with support of officials 
    &amp; monarch and they take Gran Canaria 1478-1482, Tenerife 1484-1496 &amp; 
    La Palma. <br>

    <font size="+1">Status of Aborigines...</font> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Conquest brought many changes to Aborigines. From ecological, 
    to social. Europeos brought new plants, illnesses and social system. Aborigines 
    mostly stay with old activities, but some, who collaborate with europeos, 
    receive land and better status. Those who did not collaborate were sold as 
    slaves or sent on other islands. Anyway process is not same for all classes 
    and members of Guanarteme receive titulo of Don. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <font size="+1">Social system...</font> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Colonization of archipelago destroy old system in all levels. 
    Also those who accept new system also hade to except new language, economy, 
    politic, religion... etc. On social organization there were three levels: 
    dominate, depended and slaves. In the first class were europeos represented 
    with: Castellanos, Andaluces, Gallegos and Portuguese, and also aborigines 
    who collaborate with them. They have land and influence on political and economic 
    system. Second class were mostly represented by aborigines. They have small 
    propitiates in land or work in handwork field. Slaves are minority from Africa 
    and some of aborigines. They mostly work in sugar lands.<br>
