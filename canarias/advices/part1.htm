        Well as you can imagine there are always some problematic area with bad 
        people truing to make money by cheating or robing. If you are ready to 
        pay 7.95$ you will find the answer on following question:<br>
        <br>
        <span class="tablenewpitanje">Where are the WATCH OUT areas in Gran Canaria, 
        what is the danger that exist for tourists, and tricks that bad boys are 
        using, if any ...?</span> <a href="../protected/index.htm"><br>

      <td width="24" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; </td>
      <td align="center" valign="top" width="286" class="tablenew" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">First, 
        in Spain the car that is inside of oval crossroads do have the advance. 
        Do not stop inside, please... It is OK to brake the golden rule of right 
        side, left side, but do not brake inside the oval, even as you think that 
        you will crash in other cars!<br>
        <br>
        Also if the view is nice and you slow down to look, do not forget that 
        somebody can be behind you, and could not be interested in that gorgeous 
        peace of rock. For example ME!</td>

          Security<br>
          <br>
          Well, hopefully the place is safe. And I mean that. In Gran Canaria 
          there are no serious problems on the streets as long as you follow the 
          common sense. Of course, even with government &amp; police that are 
          doing everything possible to guarantee your security, there is always 
          possibility of thief &amp; robbery. <br>
          <br>
          And when I say common sense I mean that sometimes tourists are inviting 
          bad boys. What to hell are you (some of you) doing in 5 o'clock in morning 
          completely drunk (without any idea where to hell is your hotel and with 
          fool pockets of money) on empty street. Even a saint will hardly resist! 
          You will be robed by less drunk tourist from Glabden-Blabdenbron am 
          Blau Donay... take a taxi instead, please.<br>
          <br>
          Or you go to the beach and leave everything there on sand (hidden in 
          plastic bag &amp; buried 7.5 centimeters in sand) and then you go to 
          swim, THE whole family I guess. OK as long as you have only sandwich 
          (do not hide it in sand...), cheap glasses, sun protection oil and 10&euro;. 
          Why in the name of Jesus some tourists go on fully loaded beach (thousand's 
          of persons) with passport and all of their money, I mean I saw them 
          taking almost everything.<br>
          <br>
          They say that it is for security reasons (not to be robed in bungalow 
          by room service...) Simply just take care about yourself and you will 
          not have any problems... or, check pay site for more information's...<br>
          <br>
          Insects<br>
          <br>
          On happy place I live, as we have no dangerous insects or as a meter 
          of fact bad animals at all. No snakes, no scorpions, nothing that can 
          harm you. <br>
          <br>
          We have small spiders that always walks with their ass in front instead 
          of head... and we have cats, dogs... (Presa Canaria also, unfortunately) 
          no sheep's.. No mosquitos almost at all except few that looks as big 
          as butterfly's. One cow... few bulls (cow asked for them).<br>
          <br>
          And we have very interesting little black insect that is very simpatico... 
          and I think is immortal to. You can beat him with steel hammer and he 
          will still be looking in you by gently shaking his head... Looks familiar 
          to you?<br>
          <br>
          ... and we have cucarachas, and that can be problem. No comment. How 
          big? Pay 7.95$ to know answer on following question:<br>
          <span class="tablenewpitanje"><br>
          My neighbor have told to me that Canary Islands have been invaded with 
          cucarachas !!! AAAAA!!!! Is it try?</span><br>
