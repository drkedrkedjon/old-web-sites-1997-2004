        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern technology and laboratory analysis performed 
        with potassium - argon, has made possible the discovery of unknown aspects 
        of the geological past of our Archipelago. For example, it is now known 
        that Gran Canaria was the third island to emerge from the depths of the 
        Atlantic Ocean. Its precise location is at parallel 28 N and meridian 
        15-' 30' West. Its current shape is the result of three cycles of volcanic 
        eruptions which occurred throughout many millions of years.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one took place in the Miocene between 
        fourteen (the oldest) and nine million years ago, which gave rise to the 
        Caldera de Tejeda, considered to be the mother crater of the island, whose 
        rocks and debris occupied an area of one thousand cubic kilometers. After 
        prolonged earth tremors, came the deafening sounds of the volcano spewing 
        out toxic gas, torrents of fire and molten rock, that had been ripped 
        away from the crust, thousands of meters below. Transformed into liquid 
        rivers of lava, at temperatures of 195,000 degrees, the molten mass ran 
        down the mountain at speeds of over 50 kilometers per hour. This description 
        is based on a likeness of the eruption of the Teneguia volcano, that took 
        place on the island of La Palma from 27th October to the 18th of November 
        1971. We still remember experiencing the incredible strength of nature, 
        that at unbelievable temperatures made the blue waters of the Atlantic 
        boil at the touch of the blazing lava.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second eruption occurred in the Pliocene, 
        in the same high region, between three and a half and four and a half 
        million years ago. Our island increased in size then by about one hundred 
        cubic kilometers. These formidable magmatic explosions produced rivers 
        of lava that filled the hollows formed on much of the island by the effects 
        of the previous volcano. This formation was given the Canarian name &quot;Roque 
        Nublo&quot;. This name has been accepted by volcanists the world over 
        to describe formations of a similar type.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third cycle, known as recent, occurred eight 
        hundred thousand years ago and continued until three thousand years ago. 
        It determined the current geography of Gran Canaria shaped and re - shaped 
        by the breaking waves and meteors whose action endangers the beautiful 
        monoliths, such as the Dedo de Dios (Cod's Finger) in Agaete. The knowledge 
        of what occurred on the island in former times is no less astounding than 
        the fact that the waters that lap the Archipelago plunge to depths of 
        up to 5000 meters. The study of water samples taken at different depths 
        and subsequent investigations, hope to find new material that will help 
        us to understand the important changes that the transport of heat produces 
        on the Canarian climate. It was discovered that during the glacial period, 
        specifically in the second inter glaciation, Gran Canaria was larger. 
        As one part of its coastline was submerged, the island's perimeter was 
        reduced and a change of climate took place, making it wetter than before. 
        A sounding of a sediment sample 24 meters below the surface, was found 
        to be over a million years old. Other important things were also discovered, 
        such as the existence of submerged valleys and cliffs not far from our 
        shores.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last century two very different sites were 
        discovered the first called Paleocanarian by geologists and Tamaran or 
        Old Island by historians: the second, Neocanarian or New Island. The boundaries 
        of both are marked by a natural breakwater that stretches from the historic 
        and beautiful region of Guayedra (Agaete), towards the Northwest and Southwest 
        and ends on the plains of Juan Crande in the south of the island. The 
        largest geological rifts in Gran Canaria, are situated on the central 
        slope of the peak where the Tejeda Parador (State run hotel) is located. 
        From this point you can contemplate the amazing sight of these rifts, 
        Pechos de la Cumbre and Pozo de las Nieves, the highest point of the island 
        (1 950 m) Deep, sinuous and extensive cliffs such as those at Tejeda, 
        Siberio or Tirajana with its enormous crater; the beautiful and proud 
        lithic figure of the Fraile; the grandiose and historic monoliths known 
        as Nublo and Bentaiga: the mountain range of Aserrador an apocalyptic 
        vision that looks like a storm turned to stone.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171volcanos have been found on the so called New 
        Island, or Neocanarian, 77 of which are situated in the northern part 
        and 94 to the east of the center. Some form symmetric mountains. others 
        are in the shape of horns, craters and calderetas and calderitas (cauldrons), 
        Canarian words accepted by science as a name for these types of formations.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the myth of Atlantis has been refuted by modern 
        investigation, the visitor asks himself and us also, how the miracle of 
        life has been possible in the impressive scenario of Canarian nature.<br>
