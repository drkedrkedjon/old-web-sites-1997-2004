        OK, you like money, so and I. Internet is (as you have probably noticed 
        till now) not free at all. So I do have small PAY-SITE where I have few 
        extra pages with my personal recommendations regarding Gran Canaria. If 
        you want to access that information's please use your, probably empty, 
        credit card and spend 7.95$ It is not to much but it can save you few days.

        You can drink any beer (imported) you want but I do recommend local beer 
        named TROPICAL as it is excellent beer. Simply give it try and you will 
        drink it, I know. If you still want that "Worst weis braon shwarz echte 
        Oberglauben beer..." you have too look forward to visit our psychologist 
        once you go back home... Also small beer is "Kaña" & 1/2 litter is "Jara"

          <br>
          Housing...<br>
          <br>
          The geological structure of islands have determined the way of living 
          and housing. Excluding Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, where they use volcano 
          pipes, Aborigines lived in natural caves. Also with natural caves they 
          use artificial caves. We can found presents of artificial caves mostly 
          in Gran Canaria. They are oval caves with more than one rooms. Some 
          form of windows are also in use. Many of caves have geometrical paintings 
          on walls. On Gran Canaria could be found also some housing on superficies. 
          Oval houses with one or more rooms made from rocks without any cementing. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Politics...<br>
          <br>
          On Gran Canaria civil political institutions was Guanarteme, elected 
          from nobles close to dynasty. Religion were in hands of Faycan, member 
          of Guanarteme. Besides those were two more. One civil made from: Guanarteme, 
          Faycan and different nobles, who had function of communicating with 
          king about questions regarding government and justice. Second was military 
          named Sabor, and is possible that functionality was only in times of 
          crisis. <br>
          <br>
          Economy...<br>
          <br>
          On all islands, except Gran Canaria, basis de economy was pastoral. 
          Cabra, sheep and pig were present. Agriculture is on secondary position. 
          On opposite, Gran Canaria and north de Tenerife were agricultural with 
          high technical development. Also fruits and coastal fishing bring goods 
          to people. In the field of production is present ceramic, but mostly 
          made by family for they necessities, wood industry is present very little, 
          production of tolls is made on basis of rocks, because there is no metal 
          on islands. At end, of course, many products made from fibre vegetal 
          and leather.<br>
