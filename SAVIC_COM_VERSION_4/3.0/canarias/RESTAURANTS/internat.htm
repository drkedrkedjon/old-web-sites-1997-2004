        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about international cuisine in Gran Canaria 
        is not difficult. With so many tourists to serve, many interesting peoples 
        who make living making food, from all around world found this island as 
        home and open restaurants. You will found fare east restaurants as China, 
        Thai, Japan... Many people from Cuba, so here is chance for little bit 
        of Carib cuisine. Do not miss Argentinean beef. I think it's best on world. 
        Indian restaurants maybe. If you like curry here they are. Also few African 
        and Arab restaurants. Of course all European cuisine is present: Italian 
        pasta and German sausages. Scandinavian and Swiss... etc.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must mention that all those restaurants are 
        located in urban areas. You wont found them outside big cities and tourist 
        areas.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also follow &quot;Photo tour&quot;. There I will 
        recommend some of restaurants.</h3>
