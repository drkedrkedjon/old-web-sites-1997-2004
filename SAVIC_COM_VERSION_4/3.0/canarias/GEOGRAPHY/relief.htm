        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the new territory that emerged from the 
        ocean, over the years life begins. Carried by the wind the seafaring birds 
        chose to build their nests on the solitary rocks or rested and played 
        on them, thereby fertilizing the ground with their organic waste They 
        were the first animals to set foot on this isolated and deserted land, 
        which over the years, became the habitat of other creatures and plants. 
        Different natural mechanisms were to influence the island s vegetation 
        both directly and indirectly. Seeds whose structure had become adapted 
        to being moved around, carried in the feathers of birds, would travel 
        with them for thousands of miles.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other seeds arrived mixed in with the mud caked 
        on to the birds feet Another important vehicle in this scattering of seeds 
        was the digestive system of the migratory birds As they were not digested, 
        the seeds were expelled with the excrements, whose humidity, if the soil 
        and climate are suitable, flavors growth.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way for the seeds to get to the Canaries, 
        that has existed throughout time. is on the branches of fruit bearing 
        trees that float along with the currents, ending up on our shores. Obviously 
        most of the seeds are lost and only those that find a suitable climate 
        and soil, germinate However. our island has been lavished with these two 
        elements, and therefore many different types of plants proliferated, turning 
        the stony mass of Gran Canaria, into a veritable orchard. Recent paleontoligic 
        studies have brought to light that the plants that View from the Anden 
        Verde observation point. grow nowadays in Gran Canaria come from different 
        parts of the world. although there is a high percentage of European Mediterranean 
        and African ones Amongst the plants that have been classified as the oldest 
        in the Canary Islands. are the verodes and taJinastes (typical plants 
        from the Canary Islands); both may belong to the colonization that took 
        place at the end of the tertiary age Dragon trees and milk thistles are 
        the second oldest, originating in east and south Africa. Laurel barbuzano 
        til (types of tree that constitute the laurel family) and other endemic 
        species form part of the impressive laurisilva (wet forrest) that grew 
        all over Gran Canaria even after the conquest, and can still be found 
        around the summit of the central hills The Canarian pine tree, the lord 
        of our hills, is another tree with peculiar characteristics that arrived 
        in Gran Canaria at the end of the tertiary age According to botanists 
        its closest relative is found in the Himalayas. Canarian laurels come 
        from the misty forests (nubiselva) of the Mediterranean and arrived on 
        our island at the end of the tertiary age. Due to the excellent climatic 
        conditions it found here this vegetation has remained unchanged whilst 
        in the places it originated in, it was transformed or lost forever due 
        to the sudden temperature changes and drying up of the ground after the 
        glaciation of the quaternary era. Agave. Escobones and retamas (types 
        of plant) grow around the medium heights and peaks of our island, by the 
        forests of pinus canariensis. They form part of the xerophilous (plants 
        that have adapted to arid conditions) forests and brushwood. species that 
        arrived on Gran Canaria through the Atlas Mountains. from the Mediterranean. 
        Gorse and tarajales are two of the plants that appeared recently. which 
        originated in the Sahara. The different varieties of mint whose aromatic 
        and medicinal leaves are so pleasant, come from southern Africa and South 
        America whose closest relative is a herb found in the Himalayas and western 
        China have turned into attractive and elegant bushes in the Canary Islands. 
        They have diversified into two basic types, giving rise to 450 species 
        that grow in Macaronesia (the Canaries, Madeira Azores and Cape Verde) 
        that are unique in the world As many plants were isolated in the Canaries 
        after the tertiary age, they evolved independently from their closest 
        relatives. This is why there are no less than 1,800 native species growing 
        on this Archipelago, 242 of which are endemic to Gran Canaria, and are 
        considered unique in the world.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our island is in the middle of the Atlantic, 
        1,000 km away from the Iberian peninsula and 115 km from the African continent, 
        the animal population here is a mystery to many residents, as well as 
        to visitors. We will try to unravel this puzzle on the basis of the information 
        revealed in the latest scientific studies. I The different groups of animals 
        arrived here either blown by the wind, flying by their own means, or using 
        vegetation as rafts. Insects, birds and bats form part of the first and 
        second groups. The last group covers animals brought by man and includes 
        the green frog from south east Europe and north Africa, currently in danger 
        of extinction. The lizard world is of particular interest in the Canary 
        Islands. One of the species. according to fossil remains found on the 
        western islands is 1 0 million years old The lizards living today are 
        between 0.50 and 0.60 meters in length. In Gran Canaria they are called 
        Lacerta stehlini and in El Hierro, Lacerta simony simony, found in the 
        Roque de Salmor, where they can measure up to one meter. They are not 
        dangerous, only eating plants The Salmor lizards on El Hierro are considered 
        unique in the world They are protected and were chosen as the symbol of 
        that island under the autonomic law passed on 30th April 1991. The wonderful 
        and multicoloured bird world is represented in the Canaries by 61 nesting 
        species, that is they reproduce on our archipelago. However, many others 
        are migratory, stopping here regularly on their journey to other lands 
        or spending the winter here. A third group of birds is made up of those 
        who are rare or occasional visitors to the islands. One of their favourite 
        places to stop and break up their journey between their winter and summer 
        homes until the middle of this century was the Charca de Maspalomas Even 
        today you can still spot many of them on this comfortable aquatic orchard.<br>
