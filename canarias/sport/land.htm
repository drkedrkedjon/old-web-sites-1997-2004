        OK, you like money, so and I. Internet is (as you have probably noticed 
        till now) not free at all. So I do have small PAY-SITE where I have few 
        extra pages with my personal recommendations regarding Gran Canaria. If 
        you want to access that information's please use your, probably empty, 
        credit card and spend 7.95$ It is not to much but it can save you few days.

        Soon I will make extra page for mountain biking here as I know many interesting 
        places. Also note that there are few rent-a-bike shops on south but if 
        you are really in &quot;biking&quot; you better bring your own bike. It 
        can be done for free if you say to your tourist agents.<br>
        It is not, than remember here we do not have many good bikes for rent, 
        we have some but they are usually already rented in advance and since 
        the off roads are very hard and remote, you do not want to have some tech. 
        problem with bike in middle of nowhere.</td>

          The fact that we are located in Africa give us 365 days of perfect weather 
          for any outside sport.<br>
          <br>
          Tennis<br>
          <br>
          As you can imagine there is hundreds of tennis playing field. Almost 
          all better hotels have at least one if not more (ask your our operator). 
          Few tennis clubs with many playing fields. Located all around island. 
          Possibility to rent equipment<br>
          <br>
          Golf<br>
          <br>
          Up till now we had two playing fields. One in north of island close 
          to Bandama volcano and other is Campo de Golf in Maspalomas on south 
          of island. Now we have 4. In the nee of Faro is in process construction 
          of new 5th golf course in Playa de Meloneras and that is also a brand 
          new city built around. As for the plans, they are simple... Government 
          is pushing to build up to 22 golf courses and to make this place as 
          golf paradise. It is possible simply because you can enjoy perfect golfing 
          in perfect weather conditions in middle of February. And you spent more 
          money than average tourist. He, he, he...<br>
          <br>
          Biking<br>
          <br>
          Any, but especially Mountain Biking. Same as in other open sports, weather 
          is playing main factor. Plus the unbelievable landscapes. RECOMMENDED 
          especially south of island. I personally have passed some 8000KM in 
          2 years and it is beautiful to ride here. Once I have time I will write 
          more information's. Not for the beginners and children at all. From 
          intermediate till very difficult courses. 2-8 hours. Top of mountain 
          is on 2000meters so if you go there you will have to sweat a lot...<br>
          <br>
          Climbing or trekking<br>
          <br>
          Could be beautiful experience if you are in walking king of sport. Organized 
          with some clubs. They take you up with bus and you go down by walk. 
          RECOMMENDED. You can go also from down to top but then you will be looked 
          by those who go from up to down as crazy. (Or I did, since I was going 
          with bike, not by foot, and they all sad to me that there is no more 
          road up there... I did find one nasty track... and went on top of island)<br>
