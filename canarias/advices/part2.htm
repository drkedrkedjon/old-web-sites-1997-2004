        Medical insurance,<br>
        <br>
        As I have written already, your medical insurance is fully accepted in 
        Spain, but if you are willing to pay 7.95$ you can find on my pay site the 
        answer on following question:<br>
        <br>
        <span class="tablenewpitanje">I have heard that we must pay for medical 
        assistance even if we have all documents issued by our Insurance office 
        specially for tourists in Spain. Is it try?</span><br>
        <br>
        <a href="../protected/index.htm">&gt;&gt; CLICK HERE &lt;&lt;</a></td>
      <td width="24" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; </td>
      <td align="center" valign="top" width="286" class="tablenew" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> 
        Well, that is something you have simply to accept. It has been finally 
        regulated by low so if you have been &quot;attacked&quot; by somebody 
        that have special fluorescent yellow jacket with INFO written on and with 
        special ID issued by local authorities, do say hello... and it is OK to 
        go or speak with them , if you want.<br>
        And if they are without that jacket on, then they are selling or bad restaurant 
        or bad women's or bad stuff...<br>
        Also as time goes passing, more and more of ticketeros are removing their 
        fluorescent jackets... Same as rest of the world... I saw on CNN.</td>

          As you can imagine you will need your passport. Well, if you are coming 
          from &quot;EU Shingen area&quot; than &quot;maybe&quot; you will not 
          need passport as your personal ID card is enough (&amp; credit card 
          please, as you suppose to spent some money here also). Anyway take the 
          passport with you as there are always enough stupid people around. If 
          you are coming from outside of EU please check with Spanish consulate 
          in your home land as you may need visa for legal entry. If you are planing 
          to became illegal immigrant, go away, as this is not web site for you... 
          And if you are from some Balkan country and want to illegally immigrate 
          in this beautiful land go to HELL!!!!<br>
          <br>
          Also it is highly recommended to check with your medical insurance office 
          about documents that you may need if you have to use medical assistance 
          in Spain. Your insurance is accepted in Gran Canaria, but there could 
          be one small problem... <span class="tablenewpitanje">check my pay site 
          for more info!</span><br>

          Time Sharing<br>
          <br>
          If you don't want to purchase one week of holiday in one room for whole 
          life (without transport) for some BIG 00.000&euro; than stop reading. 
          If you have a such plan, please read this!<br>
          <br>
          Time sharing is not theft, it is flat business as any, neither I am 
          advising you that time sharing is bad investment, only I say that what 
          you think that you are buying, is probably not what are you really paying 
          for. But if you are smart enough than scratch...<br>
          <br>
          If you are not so smart then simply do not scratch as you may scratch 
          your head...<br>
          <br>
          And if you from some time sharing company do not worry, those that scratch 
          do not read this. <br>
          <br>
          &iquest; OK?</p>
