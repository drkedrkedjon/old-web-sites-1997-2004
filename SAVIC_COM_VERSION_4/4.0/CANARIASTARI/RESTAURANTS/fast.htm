  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is hundreds of so called &quot;fast food&quot; 
    restaurants on Gran Canaria. But non of them looks as Mc.Donald's. There is 
    few Mc.Donalds on island but I newer eat in them. Local fast food is so good 
    and so cheap that it is unbelievable. Outside of tourist area, you can get 
    half of chicken with chips for 250 PTA. Second half of chicken You can eat 
    in near by restaurant for 850 PTA. It is three times cheaper. And it taste 
    better, somehow.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I won't named restaurants because menu of them 
    will be listed in &quot;Photo tour&quot; segment of this site. Every city 
    have restaurants and putting them all together on one page will not be interesting. 
    My advice is: the smaller and without tourists, the better.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will here only mention one place: &quot;Pepe Chiringo&quot; 
    in Playa del Ingles. There is more people there in Saturday, than in church 
    in Sunday...</h2>
