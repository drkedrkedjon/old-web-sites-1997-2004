  <h2><b><font size="+2"><font size="+3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T</font></font>here 
    is few canarian specialities when We talk about clime. First is wind that 
    comes from influence of anticyclone in Azores. It is always present, in same 
    direction and in constant power, depending on season, that make this island 
    &quot;the place&quot; for windsurfing. Of course wind is more important for 
    local people, because it brings heavy humidity from Atlantic ocean. <br>
    <font size="+3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H</font>umidity, pushed by wind in upper 
    levels of island mountains, fall on land in form of &quot;horizontal rain&quot;. 
    This is second speciality of canarias. Horizontal rain is mostly present in 
    autumn and winter and mostly in north of island. Sometimes when anticyclone 
    goes more on south it bring cold weather and normally raining.<br>
    <font size="+3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W</font>hen anticyclone goes more on north 
    it brings &quot;Shiroco&quot;, nasty wind from Sahara with sand and no humidity 
    at all. It brings temperature in upper 40. This is next speciality.<br>
    </b><font size="+3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</b></font><b>nd maybe the last 
    speciality is diversity of clime in one island. You can drive around island 
    in one day and change all weathers situation in few hours. You will catch 
    warm rain in north, fog and snow in mountains and sunny beaches in south.
