  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will seriously recommend to you that all of your 
    shopping do in shopping centers. Any street vendors are unsafe. Here in Gran 
    Canaria everything is located in shopping centers.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Las Palmas:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is top class house named &quot;El Corte Ingles&quot;. 
    Do not miss opportunity to visit it. Unfortinatlu class goes with price. It 
    is most expenses but probably best here.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Las Arenas&quot; is second important center. 
    Menu small boutiques and shops. Huge megastore &quot;Continente&quot;also 
    there.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;La Ballena&quot;, relatively new center. Nice 
    prices. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playa del Ingles:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cita&quot; Mostly German place. Gold, watches, 
    electronic.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jumbo&quot; Similar to Cita in day time. Over 
    night gay scene is here<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Faro2&quot; Good place for cloth shopping, little 
    bit expensive<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Kasbah &amp; Metro&quot; Some shopping but you 
    will probably spend night there. It is night life center here.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is couple more centers like one in San 
    Agustin but they are not so important.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Puerto Rico&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It have only one Shopping center and there is available 
    everything. Mostly English place.<br>
