  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is same reason for golf players to came here 
    as for everybody else. Weather!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in Europe you can play golf on warm sunny day 
    in February? Well you can, but is it going to rain?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here exists two golf playgrounds. One in Maspalomas 
    in Campo de Golf, and other in north of island, near by Bandama volcano crater 
    in Santa Brigita. Both are in good conditions.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also &quot;Gran Canaria Open&quot; tournament 
    with top players from all around the world, but since there is no rain, there 
    is less grass. Nothing that you should worry about.<br>
