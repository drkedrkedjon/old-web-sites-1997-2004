  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent weather condition make this island small 
    paradise for mountain biking. You can ride all year around, and since rain 
    days a rare...<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A part of weather, possibility to ride bike on so 
    strange volcanic island, with fantastic landscapes is more than gift. There 
    is no natural scenery in Europe like this. And tracks where you ride are wild 
    and rocky.<br>

    professional riders. You can clime up to top of island on 2000 meters.<br>

    in one year. I clime top and bottom of island and will be happy to help you 
    if you plan to ride here, so send me <a href="mailto:sasa@maptel.es">E-mail</a>.<br>
