  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I know that there is no safe area on his world 
    but this island is well known for small number of crimes directed against 
    people and tourists.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By following some of basic rules you will be safe 
    during your holidays.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tourist areas and beaches do not have any important 
    documents, credit card or lot of money with yourself. It is because you can't 
    watch your things when you are swimming. Logical way of thinking, isn't it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also if you found yourself completely drunk in 5 in 
    morning, alone and sleeping on street, don't say that safety on Gran Canaria 
    is low.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of tourist areas follow simple rule. Do same 
    as previously, plus don't look as tourist. It is good for your safety, (Las 
    Palmas is big city)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is mater of good style, 850.000 persons live 
    here, and they don't like naked body's in city center.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other rules to follow. There is no street 
    crime and gangs here. But if you are stupid, well I am sorry...</h2>
