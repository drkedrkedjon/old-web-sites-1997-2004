  <h2><b><font size="+3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T</font>he temperatures on Grand 
    Canaria is always pleasant. Medium temperature is somewhere around 18&ordm; 
    grad Celsius. It does not varieties many over day, or as a meter of fact, 
    over all year. The main influence on weather have anticyclone situated in 
    zone of Azores. It brings pleasant and warm clime &amp; warm waters. Local 
    people maybe will not agree with description of clime as forever spring, but 
    for somebody from European continent, Christmas on sunny beaches means forever 
    spring. Basically on Gran Canaria almost never raining. The water comes from 
    meteorological phenomena called &quot;Horizontal rain&quot;.<i> </i></b> <br>
    <b><font size="+2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+3">A</font></font>nother 
    Canary specialties is wind. So important for &quot;horizontal rain&quot;, 
    and very cooling for people. It is always present and bring best windsurfers 
    on the world here on beach Pozo izquierdo. To not bee all best there is two 
    things that are not nice. Schiroco, very nasty hot wind from Sahara filled 
    with sand. Second is when anticyclone is to south than the wind coming from 
    cold areas, and it is raining vertically.</b></h2>
