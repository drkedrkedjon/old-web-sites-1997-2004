        OK, you like money, so and I. Internet is (as you have probably noticed 
        till now) not free at all. So I do have small PAY-SITE where I have few 
        extra pages with my personal recommendations regarding Gran Canaria. If 
        you want to access that information's please use your, probably empty, 
        credit card and spend 7.95$ It is not to much but it can save you few days.

          Sun Protection<br>
          <br>
          Please, once you arrive and before you burn your skin, use a skin protection 
          products. Start with at least factor 15, or more even better (30 is 
          not to much). To expose white fresh unprotected skin on direct sunlight 
          could be very dangerous. Children under age of 3 must stay in shadow. 
          Me to! It is not bla, bla, bla, from doctors. Do protect yourself and 
          than you can relax on the beach. Bu the way, a side of danger, fresh 
          burned red skin looks less sexy. Could be your skin... <br>
          <br>
          Fast Food<br>
          <br>
          Please be aware that here, as anywhere else in the world, there are 
          some dirty places. Look for details. More clients, better. Check the 
          food, do not use ketchup if it is already on table and not brought from 
          refrigerator with hamburger. Specially look for small burger places. 
          Otherwise bon appetite... <br>
          <br>
          Food in villages<br>
          <br>
          If you rent-a-car and go in mountains and villages please look for small 
          restaurants in villages near by the roads. They are safe, and with fantastic 
          experience as you meet with local villagers and eating same food as 
          they, with prices that are unbeatable. <br>
          <br>
          If you ever need a Dentist<br>
          <br>
          If you need dentist I can seriously recommend to you Dental Clinic BLANCODENT 
          in Las Palmas. They speak English, German & Spanish. The Clinic is situated 
          in downtown business center of Las Palmas. RECOMMENDED To visit their 
          web site please go to <a href="http://www.blancodent.com" target="_blank"><br>
          www.blancodent.com</a> <br>
          <br>
          Post office<br>
          <br>
          There is only one big post office in Playa de Ingles - Maspalomas area. 
          If you need anything more than to send post card you have to go there. 
          Also note that there is private providers in tourist areas that is not 
          on so high reputation... maybe your post card will not arrive on time... 
          <br>
          <br>
          Surfing<br>
          <br>
          Please if you want to go to surf o north of island (not windsurfing) 
          please be aware and do inform yourself by local surfers before you go 
          to water. The beach for surfing located on north of island is VERY DANGEROUS 
          Still I believe that some of you are stupid enough to go by themselves. 
          Good luck <br>
          <br>
          Rent-a-bike<br>
          <br>
          If you are really in "biking" you better bring your own mountain bike. 
          It can be done for free if you say to your tourist agents. It is not 
          that here we do not have good bikes for rent, we have them, but they 
          are usually already rented in advance and since the off roads are very 
          hard and remote, you do not want to have some tech. problem with bike 
          in middle of nowhere. Also can be problems with size. If it is only 
          to cruse around Playa del Ingles than it doesn't matter<br>
          <br>
          Negotiating the price<br>
          <br>
          Please note that if you shop in shops owned by Hindu & Arab people (you 
          will) you are expected to bargain the price. You can even bark on them. 
          If you do not you are running in danger to be described as stupid. Also 
          on the other places (some owned with same Hindu and Arabs) do not do 
          that barking... as you can be glued as primitive... You have that potentiometer 
          for fine tuning...<br>
