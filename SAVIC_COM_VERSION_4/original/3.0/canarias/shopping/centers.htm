      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will seriously recommend to you that all of 
        your shopping do in shopping centers. Any street vendors are unsafe. Here 
        in Gran Canaria everything is located in shopping centers.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Las Palmas:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is top class house named &quot;El Corte 
        Ingles&quot;. Do not miss opportunity to visit it. Unfortinatlu class 
        goes with price. It is most expenses but probably best here.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Las Arenas&quot; is second important center. 
        Menu small boutiques and shops. Huge megastore &quot;Continente&quot;also 
        there.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;La Ballena&quot;, relatively new center. 
        Nice prices. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playa del Ingles:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cita&quot; Mostly German place. Gold, watches, 
        electronic.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jumbo&quot; Similar to Cita in day time. 
        Over night gay scene is here<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Faro2&quot; Good place for cloth shopping, 
        little bit expensive<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Kasbah &amp; Metro&quot; Some shopping but 
        you will probably spend night there. It is night life center here.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is couple more centers like one in 
        San Agustin but they are not so important.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Puerto Rico&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It have only one Shopping center and there is 
        available everything. Mostly English place.<br>
