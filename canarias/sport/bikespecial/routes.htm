        <p class="header">Routes</p>
        <p>Well, this are my selection of best routes on the south of island. 
          Why only south? Because it is place where you will have your hotel (probably) 
          and it is better choice than north as you go in wilderness straight 
          up and not after many kilometers of pedaling as on north.</p>
        <p>First boring downhill: Please if you are interested in downhill go 
          with organized group. Many rent a bike business have trailers and small 
          busses that will take you uphill and than you can go with leader down. 
          For details ask in any shop that rent bikes. I will not lose time on 
          that. Price, 30 - 50 &euro; per person + bike = who knows</p>
        <p align="center"><br>
          <img src="images/fotos/na_cesti_2.jpg" width="299" height="199"></p>
        <p>What I will write is for those that want to go by themselves, alone 
          or with few friends. I will start with easy one that can be accomplished 
          by total amateur and from 5th one I will talk about pain an will finish 
          with HELL. I will scale it from 1 to 10 where 10 will be HELL...</p>
        <p>Each next route is continuations of previous one so you can easily 
          find your way home if it becomes to heavy to you.</p>
        <p>Also NO details descriptions (I will leave to your adventure spirit 
          to discover when next HELL arrives...) and NO maps (except info one 
          on bottom of page) as I make this for free and I know that some IDIOT 
          will sooner or latter lost himself in the middle of mountain and I do 
          not want to be responsible. If you want good map, by one in shop in 
          your home town, study and be responsible. OK </p>
        <p class="textmainRoute">1. Presa de Ayagaures (Difficulty: 1)</p>
        <p>You will start from &quot;Cruce de Tablero&quot; some few hundred meters 
          from &quot;Mercado de San Fernando&quot; and that will be starting point 
          for all routes. OK? Then you will go in direction of village named &quot;Ayagaures&quot; 
          After few kilometers you will pass cart track and water park named &quot;Aqua 
          Sur&quot; Straight after aquasur, the road turns sharply left but you 
          DON'T and instead go straights forward and then you have some 9 kilometers 
          of easy uphill (some 200 meters of altitude). At the end you get to 
          the dam. From there you have sharp uphill to go to top of dam. Hard 
          but short. Over there enjoy dry &amp; empty lake and take care of Swans. 
          OK? Now go home, all downhill with peasant smell of fruits in the air. 
          This one is completely on asphalt so you can take with you even somebody 
          with sensible ass...</p>
        <p class="textmainRoute">2. Monta&ntilde;a de Data (Difficulty: 3)</p>
        <p>Once you successfully escape from mad swans that are sick of stupid 
          tourists and empty lake GO LEFT and attack mountain that is left from 
          lake looking fro direction you have arrived from hotel... (do not go 
          over dam yet, OK) You will have in front of you few kilometers of uphill 
          and some few hundreds of altitude to beat. Hard if you are not in form. 
          Once you get on top than simply slide down and look houses where lives 
          one Baron fon ... and also A. Kashogi sometimes (watch for francotiradores) 
          and some idiots that have purchased villas over there Lately you will 
          pass one village where there are no idiots in the same way as before 
          but neither tourists... Afterwards use your brakes or you will finish 
          inside of bull ass in &quot;plaza de toros&quot; If you miss bull ass, 
          turn left and pedal home. Also no off road, all asphalt.</p>
        <p class="textmainRoute">3. Los 4 barancos del Sur (Difficulty: 4)</p>
        <p>Well we will start again from those mad swans... now turn right and 
          go over dam. Nice, for first time you will hit hard rocky surface and 
          will leave asphalt behind you for next 30 kilometers. You have to peal 
          uphill for few kilometers and once you get on top of hill stop! Look 
          around, have a rest and think. If you are tired and find that it is 
          hard for you go on than go home now since if you go down on other side 
          it will have no sense to go beck. OK? If you go further now you have 
          nice downhill. Enjoy. But take care. If you go to fast maybe just maybe 
          you will fall... and as road is made from sharp rocks, if you fall you 
          will cut yourself and you will look as if you just had a visit from 
          Fredy Cruger... At the bottom of downhill there are few small empty 
          old houses. DO NOT ENTER!!! Dogs!!!!!! SHIT DOGS NAMED PRESA CANARIA 
          You have been worried. Do not even look in those houses. As long as 
          you keep pedaling you will not hear dogs. Once you stop nobody will 
          ewer hear from you anymore. Then you again go up... and around... than 
          new downhill. On bottom of this one is nice cave. Go visit it, no dogs. 
          Then you go again up, shit. Around, small down and around again... Just 
          keep on riding and enjoying landscapes till you get in one big barranco 
          (canyon) named &quot;Baranco de Fataga&quot; and then look for road 
          that goes sharply right and down. Go there and not forward. Open your 
          eyes as you can easily miss it. Just go down, down, down... some parts 
          of road are damaged. Take care. Just follow the road, enjoy and you 
          are back in Maspalomas. All together 4 times you go up and down. Some 
          40 kilometers. No traffic, no people, no help, no mobil phones. Take 
          care.</p>
        <p class="textmainRoute">4. Prohibido el paso (Difficulty: 5)</p>
        <p>Hello dear crazy swans, again... (do not laugh as sooner or latter 
          HE will get you, and he gets only mans, and he attack hard and straight 
          between your legs, OK? I know the owner, he is also straight!) This 
          time follow the road that goes forward following what was few years 
          ago nice coast of nice lake... You will see in background another dam. 
          That is where you have to go. Before you reach dam (you will newer get 
          there by the way as you go left and UP before...) you will have one 
          and only test for the following 4 routes. OK. If you can go without 
          stopping and without hurting your muscles and breathing for next few 
          kilometers till you reach a top of pass with traffic sign &quot;prohibido 
          el paso&quot; &quot;Forbidden to go further&quot; when translated, than 
          you are OK. If not than do finish this one as worst is behind you but 
          do not attempt to go on next one. OK? Now go home as there is sign that 
          is telling to you that it is forbidden to go further and could be also 
          chain over road... but if you do not speak any other language except 
          Albanian I do not now what to do... from here on you are leaving civilization. 
          Respect nature and take care about yourself and equipment. Now you have 
          some more kilometers to pedal up and down and up and down till you reach 
          end of road with beautifully small unhabitet old canarian village with 
          old houses made from rocks, they are not ruins. Very peaceful place 
          but do not enter as it is private and owners sometime spent some weekends 
          there. Do not burn anything or make barbecue please. Be nice. OK! Now 
          have a look further... you will see big mountains and no road at all. 
          That is where I will take you. If you fell more than only slightly tired 
          and/or fell fear from going further go home by the same road as you 
          arrived and forget next one... If not, and if you have adventuristic 
          soul... and if you are not ALONE...</p>

        <p class="textmainRoute">5. Cruz grande (Difficulty: 8)</p>
        <p>First go early as the sun comes up (I needed 8 hours to get on top 
          of island and than to go to Las Palmas down). Secondly do not go alone, 
          please. I did first time and newer again. You will go in wild forest 
          &amp; inhabited mountains with no roads and no telephones. There are 
          some less crazy people then I was that are passing from up to down with 
          same road/oppose direction but it can be two days till heavy traffic 
          in Sunday. OK! Take loads of food, energy &amp; WATER, WATER, WATER. 
          OK.??? Good maps, compass if you need one. GPS. Porno magazines also, 
          who knows. Nobody goes from down to top, only I did. Respect nature 
          and animals. Recommended music from headphones &amp; MP3 player. &quot;Heroes 
          del Silencio; CD: El espiritu del vino&quot; <br>
          Lets go... from that small village go to the end of road. You will be 
          presented with chains and ramps and signs but as we speak only Albanian... 
          look over nice palm tree oasis in front of you, and on right side is 
          one mountain. You will be, hopefully, able to se narrow tiny road. It 
          is not road, it is so narrow that only if you walk you can pass there. 
          When you spot it... than it can be reached by jumping over .... and 
          passing fry palm bushes... going over water (only in winter)... putting 
          bike on shoulders... going over ruins and bingo. Here it is. Bingo, 
          now you will sent me to HELL as from hier on, you must take bike on 
          your shoulders for next 1 - 2 hours and few HUNDREDS of meters of altitude... 
          it all depends on your skills. Now I am little bit crazy so I like this, 
          but if you think that mountain biking does not include fact that sometime 
          you have to exchange positions with bike... go home and pay 50&euro; 
          to be taken on hill with bus and than throw pedals and dive in stupid 
          downhill. OK?<br>
          Now if you continua note that on first part you have to go uphill and 
          it is sharp and zig - zag. Watch your steps, nobody wants to bee hurt 
          now. Do not yet attempt to ride bike. Once you get on (what you think 
          is top and it is not) top of mountain on right, than you have also to 
          go around mountain in front and on left... and more up... now you should 
          enter in light forest and if you have good skills balancing bike and 
          have full suspension bike you may try to ride the bike occasionally. 
          Take care as place is hard and full of roots. Do not forget to enjoy 
          nature, you are not racing. Take a breaks sometimes, watch that porno 
          magazine.... Now once you get behind of that mountain you have to get 
          close to one more mountain on right side where at one moment you will 
          have sharp uphill on right side (The mountain is named &quot;Los Moros 
          de la Vaca&quot;. You must go zig-zag as it is so sharp. On top, after 
          few huntress of meters you will hit the road. Hard and wide mountain 
          road. End of walking. If you didn't thrown away you bike in ambis before, 
          now you can exchange position with him once again.<br>
          Now, please I repeat get yourself good map even before you arrive on 
          Gran Canaria. There are few mountain roads over there and you have to 
          go on place named CRUZ GRANDE that is on top of mountain. That is place 
          where you will hit asphalt road and civilization again. In general keep 
          the mountain on right side and always go uphill. Do not go left and 
          down. OK! Even if you miss and went left and down do not worry but I 
          didn't ride there and I have no idea how to go down to Maspalomas. You 
          have to help yourself. If I miss I will always go back and uphill as 
          there is only one place on top of all roads and it is that CRUZ GRANDE 
          we are looking on.<br>
          Once you get there you will have to go over some ramps and chains and 
          when you turn your head back you will find sight &quot;prohibido el 
          Paso&quot;... Once on main road you will have few options to go home. 
          First is to go back with the same road you came up or to chose one of 
          next three downhill... (6, 7 &amp; 8) and if you are still alive and 
          want more, and to go up on that gorgeous rock in front of you and to 
          get on top of island (2000 meters of altitude) then go with me on route 
          9. and I will take you to HELL.</p>
        <p class="textmainRoute">6. Embolse de Chira (Difficulty: 8 including 
          guessing up here OK?)</p>
        <p>If you want to go home now and do not mind fast off road downhill than 
          now from &quot;Cruz grande&quot; turn left. After few kilometers of 
          easy ups &amp; downs you will get to place where you have one road going 
          fast down and left with direction &quot;Embolse de Chira&quot; Dive 
          in space till you get to empty lake (no swans, to cold...) Once there, 
          pass small village, ride on left side of lake till you get do dam. On 
          left side of dam begin rocky, damaged road. Just go down following map. 
          Sooner or latter you will after some 20 - 30 kilometer get to Maspalomas. 
          This is one of most popular tours with buses that takes you up there...</p>
        <p class="textmainRoute">7. Pozo Izquierdo (Difficulty: 8 including getting 
          up here OK?)</p>
        <p>If you do not want to leave asphalt anymore go right from &quot;Cruz 
          Grande&quot; and fly (rent a bike with nice breaks) down to village 
          named &quot;San Bartolomeo de Tirajana&quot; Once you pass him you will 
          get to option of two roads. Go left &amp; down to &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; 
          From there follow maps and go down to Arinaga, Vicendario or El doctoral, 
          wherever on east coast. Look on maps to find where is &quot;Pozo Izquierdo&quot; 
          beach. This is one of most famous beaches for windsurfing and can be 
          great place to relax. From there follows the main road on south and 
          go back to Maspalomas. Note that it is long run, some 60 - 70 kilometers 
          from &quot;Cruce Grande&quot; and is recommended only in summer when 
          the days are long. OK</p>
        <p class="textmainRoute">8. Baranco de Fataga (Difficulty: 8 including 
          getting up here OK?)</p>
        <p>On the place where you in previous route went left &amp; down to &quot;Santa 
          Lucia&quot; now don't and instead go up &amp; right to &quot;Fataga&quot; 
          or &quot;Playa del Ingles&quot; You have few kilometers of uphill and 
          then dive in open space. After you pass that village named &quot;Fataga&quot; 
          you have two options:<br>
          One is no more hard uphill but also no more asphalt. In that case go 
          right on opposite side of canyon and you will get to rocky road and 
          after some kilometers you will be on same place as on route 3 (only 
          you will arrive from opposite side) where you have sharp turn left &amp; 
          down that you can easy miss. Do not miss it, take care about damaged 
          road down and ride down to Maspalomas<br>
          Other is one more hard uphill but all asphalt. In that case follow the 
          asphalt road. You will go more down, than at the end you have hard uphill. 
          Once on top, you have final 9 kilometers down to Maspalomas.</p>
        <p class="textmainRoute">9. Pico de las nieves (Difficulty: 10 HELL)</p>
        <p>Nice boy, I call it hell as you already get to some 1600 meters of 
          altitude and you have to go down some 200 meters and than to go up 600 
          till you reach the top of Gran Canaria. Now we are tired and that is 
          HELL. At the end, the rest of 600 meters is hard but OK, if we forget 
          that you are coming from ground 0 and that you are tired. OK! Now turn 
          left and ride some kilometers, pass that &quot;Chira&quot; road on left, 
          go straight, ride more kilometer, relax but keep roiling as we do not 
          want to call of your muscles. OK? Once you get to village named &quot;Ayacate&quot; 
          stop. Have two red bulls and look uphill on right. That is few hundred 
          meters in few kilometers. Good luck, you are in hell. Turn right and 
          pedal. I will wait on top.<br>
          Welcome dead man. There is normally small shop there. Bu few more red 
          bulls once you get there. Smoke one joint. Now keep riding some more 
          kilometers as you go up &amp; down try nice forest (hey, can you believe 
          what deference makes landscape on this altitude) Ride easily till you 
          get to place where you can go in 4 direction. One is to go beck. Do 
          not. Other is to go to &quot;Cruce de Tejeda&quot; do not. Other is 
          to go to Las Palmas as I did, do not, go uphill and left to direction 
          of &quot;Pico de las Nieves&quot; You have to sweat once again but it 
          is not to hard, BUT we are tired and it makes us nervous. Be aware as 
          this is time to make mistake. After few kilometers you will get to military 
          antenna and so on. Turn right, go behind house and once you get to end 
          of road you have done it. TOP OF GRAN CANARIA. Look down to se from 
          where you have arrived. WOW. Look right you may see Tenerife and &quot;Teide 
          volcano&quot;<br>
          Now go home. Look on your clock for time calculation. Calculate how 
          long is day. Fastest way to go home is to go beck to &quot;Ayacete&quot; 
          and then to go left to that route 6. &quot;Embolse de Chira&quot; turn 
          right and downhill to Maspalomas. Study the map. Take care.</p>
