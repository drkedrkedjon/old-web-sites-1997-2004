      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Almost 30 years in the Canaries..., 
        in this adopted my homeland where I was captivated by the magic of its 
        lights and its landscapes from the very first instant.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has always been my fervent desire to 
        see that these places of sheer beauty remain unspoiled so that future 
        generations might also take delight in such paradisiacal settings.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This collection of photographs is my tribute 
        to this land and its warm - hearted people, so those who come to visit 
        may remember their stay that bit better and longer.&quot;</h3>
