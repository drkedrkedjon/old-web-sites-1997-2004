        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you can, a part of biking, windsurfing, 
        fishing and golfing, also walk... This is not joke. Many tourist agencies 
        organize walking excursion up in mountains. They take you with bus and 
        later return in town. Very interesting!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also all kind of water activities that you can 
        imagine: sailing, surfing, waterscuters, boats, parachuting and so on... 
        All that in Puerto Rico. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tennis... and other ground sports... everywhere...<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of course you can play football, but you do 
        that at home, so why should not?<br>
