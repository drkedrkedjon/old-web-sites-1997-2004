          I know, You have to eat at least three times a day except some special 
          &quot;tourists spices&quot; that manage to pass whole day with two meals 
          (or she can manage &amp; he is suffering, au - man what a weird people). 
          Since you "have to eat", you want cheap and since you like to eat you 
          want also good food. Possible?<br>
          <br>
          Yes, but not everywhere. In most restaurants you can have good food 
          with acceptable price &amp; with all sorts of different menus. Watch 
          for non Spanish strange international restaurants. Pass them. Usually 
          sell not so fresh food. If you are looking for pizza do look for Italian 
          pizzeria. If it is international restaurants with pizza than this is 
          plastic pizza. If they say that fish is fresh ask to see food first. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Those good restaurants that sell fresh fish will be happy to show you 
          your fish still swimming, and others that sell same frozen food that 
          you by in supermarket, wont! Simply look around. Food is usually served 
          with chips, potato, salad and so on but not everywhere. Ask before you 
          order.<br>
          <br>
          Please do not miss Canary food & Argentinean ( I want my dollars back!!!) 
          beef.<br>
          <br>
          Spanish restaurants are mixed with all others, so you will found them 
          easy. Small local restaurants with good food will be listed in Photo 
          tour section once is on-line under each city or beach. I personally 
          advice to forget big Spanish restaurants from deferent Spanish provinces 
          as you will probably spent some other holidays in other parts of Spain 
          and to instead look for Canary restaurants<br>
          <br>
          Talking about international cuisine in Gran Canaria is not difficult. 
          With so many tourists to serve, many interesting peoples who make living 
          making food, from all around world found this island as home and they 
          open their restaurants. You will found far east restaurants from China, 
          Thai, Japan... Many people comes from Cuba, so here is chance for little 
          bit of Caribbean cuisine. Do not miss Argentinean beef. I think it's 
          best on world. Indian restaurants maybe? If you like curry here they 
          are. Also few African and Arabs restaurants. <br>
          <br>
          Of course al kind of European cuisine is present: Italian pasta and 
          German sausages. Scandinavian and Swiss... etc. I must mention that 
          all those restaurants are located in urban areas. You wont found them 
          easy outside big cities and tourist areas.<br>
          <br>
          Also there is hundreds of so called "fast food" restaurants on Gran 
          Canaria. But non of them looks as Mc.Donald's. There is few Mc.Donalds 
          on island but I newer eat in them. One is in Puerto Rico and other in 
          Playa del Ingles directly on beach.<br>
          <br>
          Local fast food is so good and so cheap that it is unbelievable. Outside 
          of tourist area, you can get half of chicken with chips for 4&euro;. 
          The same owner sell second half of same chicken near by restaurant in 
          tourist area for 10&euro;. It is three times cheaper. And it taste better, 
          somehow. I will name some restaurants in "Photo tour" segment of this 
          site. <br>
          <br>
          Every city have restaurants and putting them all together on one page 
          will not be interesting. My advice is: the smaller and with less tourists, 
          the better. I will here only mention one place: "Pepe Chiringo" in Playa 
          del Ingles. There is more people there in Saturday, than in church in 
          Sunday... <br>
