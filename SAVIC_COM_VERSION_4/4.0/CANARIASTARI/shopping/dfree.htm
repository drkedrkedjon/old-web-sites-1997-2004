  <h3>Duty free<br>
    shopping... ? </h3>

  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no &quot;Duty Free Shopping&quot; on Gran 
    Canaria. It is trick from the past, but it doesn't change anything for you. 
    The prices are generally smaller than in Europe for some 10 - 30%. It is because 
    taxes here are only 4.5% and not 15 - 17% like in the rest of EEU.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well it suppose to be like this but it isn't. You 
    can still by box of cigarettes here in supermarket with tax for less money 
    than in free shop in airplane, with no tax at all. And you can't take home 
    more than one box of cigarettes shopped in local supermarket which mean that 
    local supermarket is treated as free shop.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are probably in search for cheap home electronic. 
    Anything they offer to you can be bargained for 30 - 50%. If salesman offer 
    to you super price of 80.000 PTAs for video camera you can by same one with 
    little bit of negotiating for 40 - 50.000 PTAs.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side check little bit source of product 
    and does it have guarantee.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is gold opportunity for shopping. Gold is excellent 
    quality and much cheaper than in EEU because it comes from Africa and Asia 
    directly without dealers. Specially I recommend 18 karats gold. It have excellent 
    price. You, in most places can't bargain to much, but try anyway, you never 
    know.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watches, perfumes, cosmetics... by what you want, 
    nobody ask you why, and they accept all cards and money.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for me second best thing if cloth and fashion. 
    If you leave tourist south and go in Las Palmas in some of shopping centers, 
    you can by cloth from well known designers for less money than some china 
    T-shirt at your home. And don't shop china T-shirt here because cost more 
    than same at your home. Why? I don't know, that's the way of things here.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best shopping here? Try to by car. Some models here 
    are almost 50% cheaper than in Europe. You can by new Volkswagen polo for 
    13.000 German mark. You import car in Germany where you pay tax and have few 
    thousand mark for save.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need a mountain bike, it's the same story. Check little 
    bit around.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the cheapest is sun...</h2>
