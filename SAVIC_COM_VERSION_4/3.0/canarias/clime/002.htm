        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This islands of Canarias are &quot;Heavens place&quot;, 
        talking about weather. I live on Gran Canaria for few years. Did I saw 
        rain? Yes I did, ten days in one year. The rest of 355 days is sunny, 
        but newer to hot. There is always wind over day. Night is cool and pleasant. 
        Not to be perfect there is sometimes time of Shiroco, hot wind with sand, 
        from desert Sahara some 200.km away. Should I wrote that I didn't saw 
        Shiroco for last 365 days... Come here, You can wait new year swimming 
        in Atlantic ocean. Cool...</h3>
