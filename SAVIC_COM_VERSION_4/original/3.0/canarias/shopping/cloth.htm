        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is logical way of thinking to follow. If 
        somebody on street is offering to you golden Rolex watch for some 5.000 
        PTAs, you suppose to understand that it is not original watch. For that 
        price 20 meters away is available original Swatch or Omega.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side if you want &quot;that Rolex&quot;, 
        Bu it, but please understand that there is no 30 days money back guaranty, 
        or guaranty at all.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargain the price on south of island till the 
        end of vendor nerves. It is worth of time. Don't be polite with them. 
        This is not advice. It is your money. And don't bargain in Las Palmas. 
        There is Europe way of business making there.<br>
