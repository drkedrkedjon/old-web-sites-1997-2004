        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;It has been calculated that man first arrived on the Archipelago 
        some where in the year 2000 BC. The first humans to arrive on the island 
        were a group of Cro Magnons from Europe that settled in North Africa. 
        Other races such as eastern and Mediterranean peoples probably originated 
        as result of invasions from Africa and mixed with people already living 
        here. Before the arrival of the Castilians in l478 many viseded and trade 
        with locals. First were Phoenicians traders and colonists. Around the 
        year 500 BC, the Carthagenians heard of the existence of the Canaries 
        and traded with their inhabitants. <br>

        <font size="+1">Origin...</font> <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;As always many theories and ideas about origin of Aborigines. 
        Some search for mythology persons and civilizations, some in biblical 
        research, some in antic nations and people. As a meter of fact, manu believe 
        that lost continent named Atlantida were here on this islands. Well, believe 
        is believe but We will follow archeological researching. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And archeology say that Aborigines came from north of African 
        continent. Unfortunately it is still unclear why they came here. Was it 
        because of desertification of Sahara and less humidity in Magreb, or it 
        is because some political, (Romans), reasons. It is probably that depending 
        of groups and time, some came by they wishes, some for political, some 
        for economic reasons. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="+1">People...</font> <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;On Canarias the population is formed over two groups of people. 
        One lived in La Gomera, Tenerife and interior the Gran Canaria. Second 
        group were present in Gran Canaria and El Hierro. Even today the political 
        &amp; economical structure is separated between Gran Canaria and Tenerife. 
        Population was small on Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, El Hiero, La Gomera 
        &amp; La Palma (1000-4000), and Tenerife &amp; Gran Canaria had somewhere 
        about 30.000 habitants pro islands. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="+1">Housing...</font> <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The geological structure of islands determined way of living 
        and housing. excluding Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, where they use volcano 
        pipes, Aborigines lived in natural caves. Also with natural caves they 
        use artificial. We can found presents of artificial caves mostly in Gran 
        Canaria. They are oval caves with more than one rooms, and with magazines 
        &amp; etc. Some form of windows are also in use. Many of caves have geometrical 
        paintings on walls. On Gran Canaria were also some housing on superficies. 
        Oval houses with one or more rooms made from rocks without any cementing.

        <br>
        <font size="+1">Politics...</font> <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;On Gran Canaria civil political institutions was Guanarteme, 
        elected from nobles close to dynasty. Religion were in hands of Faycan, 
        member of Guanarteme. Besides those were two more. One civil made from: 
        Guanarteme, Faycan and different nobles, who had function of communicating 
        with king about questions regrading government and justice. Second was 
        military named Sabor, and is possible that functionality was only in times 
        of crisis. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="+1">Economy...</font> <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;On all islands, except Gran Canaria, basis de economy was 
        pastoral. cabra, sheep and pig were present. Agriculture is on secondary 
        position. On opposite, Gran Canaria and north de Tenerife were agricultural 
        with high technical development. Also fruits and coastal fishing bring 
        goods to people. In the field of production is present ceramic, but mostly 
        made by family for they necessities, wood industry is present very little, 
        production of tolls is made on basis of rocks, because there is no metal 
        on islands. At end, of course, many products made from fibre vegetal and 
        leather. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="+1">Religion...</font> <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;There is three levels in hierarchy of Canary religion. first 
        is God Superior, second is spiritus, and last is demons and enemy of man. 
        On all islands were one God Superior, except El Hiero where we found two: 
        Masculine and feminine called Eraorazan &amp; Moneiba. On other God is 
        cold differently: Acoran, Achaman, Orahan, Abora... God were collective 
        and for society only. He is called only in great needs, like long dry 
        periods. There were many rituals to &quot;call rain&quot;. Second level 
        was for different clans and is represented with idols and figures. Demon 
        is called Gabiot or Guayota. Deaths are mostly funeral in caves. Of course 
        it depend on social structure also. There was also mummification and on 
        Gran Canaria we found tombs in area with superficial housing. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="+1">Society...</font> <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Social structure of Canarias is tribe. There is great different 
        in same islands. On Lanzarote and El Hierro is only one tribe. On other, 
        tribe area is called &quot;guanartermato, bandos, menceyato or reinos&quot; 
        depending on islands. System was decentralized except Gran Canaria, with 
        more complex system. The society was not equally for everybody. On Grand 
        Canaria existed nobles which married between them for reasons of keeping 
        status. They were separated in two parts &quot;caballeros&quot; with pure 
        blood and &quot;hidalgos&quot; second class. The most of population belong 
        to class of &quot;plebeyos or villanos&quot;. It is interested that different 
        classes have different cloth, hair or bear style. Also justice was different 
        on different classes. <br>
