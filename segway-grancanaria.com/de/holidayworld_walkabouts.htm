            Holiday World &quot;Walkabouts&quot;<br>
            </span><br>
            <span class="maintext">Available every evening:<br>
            <br>
            19:00 - 23:00 (Sunday to Thursday)<br>
            19:00 - 24:00 (Friday &amp; Saturday)<br>
            <br>
            If you are thinking of visiting Holiday World for an evening of fun 
            on a Roller Coaster &amp; Sky Drop, plus to have a few games of bowling 
            and a good meal then, why not also check out our *&quot;Walkabouts&quot;*? 
            They are our Segway gliding sessions lasting 20-25 minutes and taking 
            place inside the Leisure Center Holiday World.<br>
            <br>
            Each session begins with a crash course that teaches you how to use 
            the machine. That's followed by some personal warm-up practice. Once 
            you feel you can do it we'll take you and the rest of your group for 
            a real glide around the Ferris Park where you will Segway in front 
            of the crowd! To make the ride more exciting we'll go to the upper 
            tier as well and back down again. You will love it!<br>
            <br>
            To summarize, &quot;Walkabout&quot; is built around 5-10 minutes of 
            training &amp; practice, followed by a 10-15 minutes supervised ride 
            which means no riding on your own is involved. All in all, that's 
            some 20-25 minutes of great fun!<br>
            <br>
            Typically, there would be a &quot;Walkabout&quot; session every hour, 
            although that can vary according to customer demand. If you don't 
            find us at the starting point when you get there, the chances are 
            we are in action and you just need to bear with us a few minutes until 
            we are back. We promise you, it's quite worth waiting for!<br>
            <br>
            Price: 15&euro; per person. Sorry, advanced bookings are not available 
            on &quot;Walkabouts&quot;. Discounts only available for groups of 
            4+. Personal sessions also available: ask at our shop for details.<br>
            <br>
