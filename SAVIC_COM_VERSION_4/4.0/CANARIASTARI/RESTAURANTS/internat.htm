  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about international cuisine in Gran Canaria 
    is not difficult. With so many tourists to serve, many interesting peoples 
    who make living making food, from all around world found this island as home 
    and open restaurants. You will found fare east restaurants as China, Thai, 
    Japan... Many people from Cuba, so here is chance for little bit of Carib 
    cuisine. Do not miss Argentinean beef. I think it's best on world. Indian 
    restaurants maybe. If you like curry here they are. Also few African and Arab 
    restaurants. Of course all European cuisine is present: Italian pasta and 
    German sausages. Scandinavian and Swiss... etc.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must mention that all those restaurants are located 
    in urban areas. You wont found them outside big cities and tourist areas.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also follow &quot;Photo tour&quot;. There I will recommend 
    some of restaurants.</h2>
