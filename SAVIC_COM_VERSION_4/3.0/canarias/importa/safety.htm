      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I know that there is no safe area on his 
        world but this island is well known for small number of crimes directed 
        against people and tourists.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By following some of basic rules you will be safe 
        during your holidays.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tourist areas and beaches do not have any important 
        documents, credit card or lot of money with yourself. It is because you 
        can't watch your things when you are swimming. Logical way of thinking, 
        isn't it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also if you found yourself completely drunk in 
        5 in morning, alone and sleeping on street, don't say that safety on Gran 
        Canaria is low.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of tourist areas follow simple rule. Do 
        same as previously, plus don't look as tourist. It is good for your safety, 
        (Las Palmas is big city)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is mater of good style, 850.000 persons 
        live here, and they don't like naked body's in city center.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other rules to follow. There is no 
        street crime and gangs here. But if you are stupid, well I am sorry...</h3>
