        islands are situated at 28&ordm; parallel, north and 15&ordm; meridian, 
        east,&nbsp; northeast coast of Africa from which is distant on closest 
        point about 100 kilometers. The archipelago is made from seven main islands 
        and four small, and they are: Gran Canaria, Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera, 
        Lanzarote, Fuerventura &amp; El Hiero. The four small islands are: La 
        Graciosa, Monta&ntilde;a Clara, Alegranca and Lobos.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Canarias made one part of archipelago together 
        with Azores, Madeira &amp; Cabo Verde. All are volcanic origin and with 
        similar ecosystem. There is many different theory trying to explain origin 
        of islands, but volcanic theory is most accepted and fact of life volcanos 
        (last eruption en La Palma, 1971), support theory about growing Atlantic 
        ocean.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most visible fact on Canary relief is altitude 
        (Tenerife, 3718 met.). From where begins many canons, deep sometimes more 
        than 1000 met. Coastal parts are very high in eastern islands and on western 
        is more flat with long sand beaches. All islands have central orientation 
        of altitude and canons that finish in ocean. Only Lanzarote, Fuerteventura 
        &amp; south of Gran Canaria have sand extensions<br>
