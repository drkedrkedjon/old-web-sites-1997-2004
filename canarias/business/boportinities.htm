        Hi, if you are willing to throw 7.95$ on my pay site, you will find answer 
        on following question: <br>
        <br>
        <span class="tablenewpitanje">Is it to late to start business in Gran 
        Canaria and if not what else I must know regarding business here</span><br>
        <br>
        <a href="../protected/index.htm">&gt;&gt; CLICK HERE</a> &lt;&lt;</td>
      <td width="24" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; </td>
      <td align="center" valign="top" width="286" class="tablenew" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> 
        The trick with tax is that in Gran Canaria consumers do not pay to Spanish 
        government in Madrid (some 15-18%). Here we and you have to pay only 4.5% 
        to the local government. That is why some thinks are cheaper here then 
        there. Like fragrances, new cars and so on. On the other side some products 
        like simple newspaper is more expansive because of extra transport. So 
        it could be paradise or hell... Also tax for tobacco, cars &amp; alcohol 
        is slowly growing so it will not be to long till it came on same level 
        as in rest of Spain. So hurry everybody in Gran Canaria...</td>

          <br>
          </span>So you have idea to make some money here? You are welcome. There 
          are many successful stories about persons from all around the World 
          that have maid some good money here, and they still make good money. 
          I am not the one. I work with Internet and nobody needs Internet here 
          (well it starts to change now). It is island in the middle of Atlantic 
          ocean and you have to sell the sun &amp; fun, for to make the money.<br>
          <br>
          Also note that there is much more people that lost all their money than 
          those that have made it. I neither belong to this group. Lucky boy, 
          am I. Usually, you lose money by smelling money on wrong place, as always. 
          There are hundreds of business on rent or for sale here. <br>
          <br>
          If they are working well then why are they about to rent them? <br>
          <br>
          This is simple question that all those that have lost money investing 
          here have answered it before they have paid for their dream. Those that 
          didn't find answer will still have the money. This is biggest advice 
          I can give!<br>
          <br>
          Also, since you have to sell the sun &amp; fun... you have to forget 
          anything else. It is simple, except beds, restaurants, bars &amp; fun 
          you can't sell anything else. If you try to sell something else, like 
          art in art gallery, you are dead man.<br>
          <br>
          It is incredible, you have three pub's in line. One on the corner and 
          second &amp; third one in line. First one is full of people, second 
          one survives and third one is constantly &quot;for rent&quot; It is 
          only 20 meters between first and third. So it is, in &quot;tourist area&quot; 
          the problem is tourist by himself...<br>
