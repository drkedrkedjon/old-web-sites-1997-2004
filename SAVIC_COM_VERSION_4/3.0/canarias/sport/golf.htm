        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is same reason for golf players to came 
        here as for everybody else. Weather!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in Europe you can play golf on warm sunny 
        day in February? Well you can, but is it going to rain?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here exists two golf playgrounds. One in Maspalomas 
        in Campo de Golf, and other in north of island, near by Bandama volcano 
        crater in Santa Brigita. Both are in good conditions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also &quot;Gran Canaria Open&quot; tournament 
        with top players from all around the world, but since there is no rain, 
        there is less grass. Nothing that you should worry about.<br>
