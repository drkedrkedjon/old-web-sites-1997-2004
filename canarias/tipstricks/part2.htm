        OK, you like money, so and I. Internet is (as you have probably noticed 
        till now) not free at all. So I do have small PAY-SITE where I have few 
        extra pages with my personal recommendations regarding Gran Canaria. If 
        you want to access that information's please use your, probably empty, 
        credit card and spend 7.95$ It is not to much but it can save you few days.

        Please, once you arrive and before you burn your skin, use a skin protection 
        creme. Start with at least factor 15, or more is better (30 is not to 
        much). To expose unprotected skin on direct sunlight could be very dangerous. 
        Children under age 3 must stay in shadow. It is not bla, bla, bla. Do 
        protect yourself and than relax on the beach. Bu the way, fresh burned

          <br>
          Fake clocks<br>
          <br>
          If you are purchasing golden Rolex from African vendors on street for 
          the price of 30€ try to understand that it is fake Rolex, same as golden 
          chains that some of them sell, and if it is OK for you than note: it 
          is up on your responsibility and is illegal. On the other hand the silver 
          from Indonesia is looks original...<br>
          <br>
          Tobacco<br>
          <br>
          I have heard some of smart tourists that are arriving here one story 
          that tobacco purchased here is not the same taste as in your country. 
          It is a wrong, but I will not comment on somebody's taste. The same 
          box of Marlboro that is available here is as in your country and is 
          made by the same manufacturer. If you still can find that it doesn't 
          taste the same then, maybe, you can start to think about stopping your 
          addiction on tobacco. It will probably kill you one of these days.<br>
          <br>
          Spanish brand names<br>
          <br>
          Do try Spanish names, they have excellent shoes & fashion stuff. Better 
          than that pumped and expensive shit of V... or cheap Hindu T-shirt... 
          Some of their brands are now most wanted in London, Paris... <br>
          <br>
          Noise<br>
          <br>
          Good thing here is that you can enjoy sex, drugs and rock an roll undisturbed. 
          But only in tourist areas and in recommended places (shopping centers). 
          If you are far away from bars DO NOT SING THAT STUPID SONG PLEASE SO 
          LOUD, AS PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING HERE ALSO, some of them... Uu,uuu babe 
          will you be my girl, hu, ha, hu-ha <br>
          <br>
          Real Estate<br>
          <br>
          Everybody can purchase real estate in Gran Canaria. It doesn't meter 
          are you from EU or from outside and can spent as much time there as 
          you want. Anyway please try to understand that if you spend more that 
          6 month in Gran Canaria you must have legal resident status and than 
          you have to pay tax in Spain regardless of your country of arrival. 
          If you are from outside of EU it can be long process since different 
          laws apply for non EU residents. Check with Spanish embassy in your 
          country for details.<br>
          <br>
          Tax<br>
          <br>
          The difference between tax is that on Gran Canaria consumers do not 
          pay what they pay to Spanish government in the rest of Spain (some 15-18%). 
          Here we and you have to pay only 4.5%. That is why some thinks are cheaper 
          here then there. Like fragrances, new cars and so on. On the other side 
          some products like simple newspaper is more expensive because of extra 
          transport. So it could be paradise or hell...<br>
          <br>
          Driving<br>
          <br>
          First, in Spain the car that is inside of oval have the advance. Do 
          not stop inside, please. It is OK to brake the golden rule of right 
          side, left side advance but do not brake inside the oval! Also if the 
          view is nice and you slow down to look, do not forget that somebody 
          can be behind you, and could not be interested in that gorgeous peace 
          of rock. <br>
          <br>
          Ticketerosi<br>
          <br>
          Well, that is something you have simply to accept. It has been finally 
          regulated by low so if you have been "attacked" by somebody that have 
          special fluorescent yellow jacket with INFO written on, do say hello... 
          and it is OK to go with them, if you want. And if they are without that 
          jacket on, then they are selling or bad restaurant or bad women's or 
          bad stuff... <br>
