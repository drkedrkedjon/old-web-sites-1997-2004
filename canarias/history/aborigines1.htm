        The accent inhabitants of Gran Canaria, known as Aborigines, have lived 
        in caves. Maybe it does look strange to you but this volcanic islands 
        have no available material for house building. That fact and volcanic 
        origin that offer many caves have been logical directions for living space. 
        Even today many of caves have been fitted for living (As weekend or holiday 
        alternative). Some of them have been fully equipped and you can even rent 
        them for living. It could be weary exciting and natural experience. </td>

          Time... <br>
          <br>
          Man first arrived on the Archipelago somewhere in the year 2000 BC The 
          first were a group of Cro Magnons from Europe that settled in North 
          Africa. Other races such as eastern and Mediterranean peoples probably 
          originated as result of invasions from Africa and mixed with people 
          already living here. Before the arrival of the Castilians in l478 many 
          visited and trade with locals. First were Phoenicians traders and colonists. 
          Around the year 500 BC, the Carthagenians traded with their inhabitants. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Origin...<br>
          <br>
          As always many theories and ideas about origin of Aborigines. Some search 
          for mythology persons and civilizations, some in biblical research, 
          some in antic nations and people. As a meter of fact, menu believe that 
          lost continent named Atlantida were here on this islands. Well, believe 
          is believe but we will follow archeological researching. And archeology 
          say that Aborigines came from north of African continent. Unfortunately 
          it is still unclear why they came here. Was it because of desertification 
          of Sahara and less humidity in Maghreb, or it is because some political, 
          (Romans), reasons. It is probably that depending of groups and time, 
          some came by they wishes, some for political, some for economic reasons.<br>
          <br>
          People...<br>
          <br>
          On Canarias the population is formed over two groups of people. One 
          lived in La Gomera, Tenerife and interior the Gran Canaria. Second group 
          were present in Gran Canaria and El Hierro. Even today the political 
          & economical structure is separated between Gran Canaria and Tenerife. 
          Population was small on Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, El Hiero, La Gomera 
          & La Palma (1000-4000), and Tenerife & Gran Canaria had somewhere about 
          30.000 habitants pro islands.</p>
