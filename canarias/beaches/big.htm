          &lt;BIG BEACHES&gt;</span><br>
          <br>
          They are all sandy, long, and crowded with people. But if you like to 
          be on the beach where everybody is, with all possible services &amp; 
          sport activities, than this is the place to be. Basically there are 
          three big beaches: Playa de Las Canteras, Playa del Ingles &amp; Playa 
          de Maspalomas. I will also include a few smaller: Playa de San Agustin, 
          Playa de Puerto Rico, ...<br>
          <br>
          Playa de Las Canteras<br>
          <br>
          Playa de Las Canteras is situated in the center of Las Palmas. It is 
          well known for beautiful yellow color of sand. Mostly visited by residents 
          of Las Palmas. Nice possibility to meet them. Of course, a great number 
          of tourists is also present. It is naturally protected by reef, so the 
          beach is safe from big waves (or big fishes, if you ask me) and is suitable 
          for small children. The beach is surrounded by commercial area with 
          many restaurants, cafe's, shops etc. Starting from there is city center, 
          so if you feel bored and want to take a walk, do it on the streets of 
          Las Palmas. <br>
          <br>
          Playa del Ingles.<br>
          <br>
          One of the most known beaches in Europe, or in Africa if you like. Famous 
          Dunas de Maspalomas mix with ocean there. It is overcrowded in most 
          parts of the year &amp; is three kilometers long. There are some big 
          waves on one part, depending of wind direction. In the near by is big 
          commercial center with many restaurants, bars and shops. (Mc Donald 
          also, if you are looking for plastic food) Basically, you can found 
          what ever you need on beach. Sport activities like jet ski, sailing, 
          water skiing and etc. are also available. Part of the beach is reserved 
          as nudists area. <br>
          <br>
          Playa de Maspalomas.<br>
          <br>
          Where Playa del Ingles ends, begins Playa de Maspalomas. The beach is 
          two kilometers long, with orientation on south so in the Summer time 
          is mostly free of big waves. At the opposite end is small shopping center 
          with restaurants and shops. Natural area named "Oasis de Maspalomas" 
          with bird nesting area and "Faro de Maspalomas", light tower are there.<br>
          <br>
          Playa de San Agustin <br>
          <br>
          The smallest and less crowded in this group. Beach is only few hundred 
          meters long, but is sandy and well protected against waves. Close to 
          beach is Shopping center. Besides tourists You will share beach with 
          residents in weekends &amp; in summer. Crowded sometimes, but nice and 
          quiet beach. Recommended. Suitable for small children.<br>
          <br>
          Playa de Puerto Rico<br>
          <br>
          Situated in small tourist city some 20 km. From Maspalomas. Mostly British 
          tourists area. It is small, sandy & overcrowded. Very well protected, 
          with big yacht marina and shopping center. This area is center for water 
          sport activities. If You like sport, here is place to be.<br>
          <br>
          Playa de Amadores<br>
          <br>
          Brand new artificial beach with huge shopping center. The beautiful 
          yellow sand is brought from India (They say that but I do not know is 
          it correct or not) Great beach even it is not natural one. RECOMMENDED 
          few hundred meters from Puerto Rico.<br>
          <br>
          ... we are also building more beaches... there is no end... <br>
