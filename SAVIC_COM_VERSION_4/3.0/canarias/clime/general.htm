        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T</font>he temperatures on Grand Canaria is always 
        pleasant. Medium temperature is somewhere around 18&ordm; grad Celsius. 
        It does not varieties many over day, or as a meter of fact, over all year. 
        The main influence on weather have anticyclone situated in zone of Azores. 
        It brings pleasant and warm clime &amp; warm waters. Local people maybe 
        will not agree with description of clime as forever spring, but for somebody 
        from European continent, Christmas on sunny beaches means forever spring. 
        Basically on Gran Canaria almost never raining. The water comes from meteorological 
        phenomena called &quot;Horizontal rain&quot;.<i> </i></b> <br>
        <b><font size="+2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+3">A</font></font>nother 
        Canary specialties is wind. So important for &quot;horizontal rain&quot;, 
        and very cooling for people. It is always present and bring best windsurfers 
        on the world here on beach Pozo izquierdo. To not bee all best there is 
        two things that are not nice. Schiroco, very nasty hot wind from Sahara 
        filled with sand. Second is when anticyclone is to south than the wind 
        coming from cold areas, and it is raining vertically.</b></h3>
