            Segway Maspalomas Tour<br>
            </span><br>
            <span class="maintext">Daily:<br>
            Morning Tour: 10:00<br>
            Afternoon tour: 15:00<br>
            <br>
            Online bookings are available (with minimum five days in advance). 
            If you are not booking online please make sure you do so in the evening 
            hours at our shop and at least one day in advance. Otherwise, due 
            to a high demand, we can not guarantee you a place.<br>
            <br>
            Our Standard Tour runs as follows.<br>
            <br>
            The starting point is our shop location in Holiday World Leisure Center, 
            Maspalomas. Here, you will be given full training in how to use the 
            Segway. The course will take no longer then 30 minutes and will include 
            a ride around the center. Ultimately, the exact duration of the training 
            will depend on the number of trainees.<br>
            <br>
            Once all the participants feel confident on the machine our journey 
            will begin. The planned route will take us along a smooth bicycle 
            lane that goes through a fine park. This path is rarely in use so 
            you'll be able to practice your moves without being hindered by the 
            traffic. Somewhere down the road you will see a petrol station but 
            then, we won't need that. You've guessed why. We run on electricity 
            :-)<br>
            <br>
            Our first destination will be Costa de Meloneras. This is a coastal 
            stretch of the road and it's full of people. Don't worry! By this 
            time you will be fully in control of your Segway. It is likely that 
            you'll be feeling like a rock star at this point, with all the attention 
            that you'll get from the crowd! The next few kilometers will see us 
            riding along the coast and it is here that you'll be given a chance 
            to glide up and down the hill a little bit. The first leg of our journey 
            will come to an end at Playa de Meloneras Shopping Center. There is 
            a fancy bar-terrace there where you'll be treated to a nice non-alcoholic 
            drink of your choice, courtesy of the organizer. After a relaxing 
            half an hour break we'll be on our way again.<br>
            <br>
            For our ride back to the base we will use a variation of the coastal 
            route leading to Faro de Maspalomas (light tower). The next item on 
            the menu will be cruising around hotels and palm oasis, followed by 
            checking at the Maspalomas Beach and Charca de Maspalomas (bird nesting 
            area). There'll be a final couple of kilometers glide to complete 
            before we're back to where it all started, the Holiday World Leisure 
            Center.<br>
            <br>
            Price: 40&euro; per person. Online booking is available for &quot;Segway 
            Maspalomas Tour&quot; only. Discount available for groups of four 
            +, personal tours &amp; customized routes negotiable. Ask before booking.<br>
            <br>
            Important Rules:<br>
            <br>
            1. Weight limit for Segway use is 45 - 115 kg.<br>
            2. Minimum age is 12. Children aged 12 to 16 must be accompanied by 
            a parent who must sign the liability form for them.<br>
            3. Children aged 16 to 18 are subject to parents signing the liability 
            form for them (they can go unaccompanied though)<br>
            4. We reserve the right to deny service to any person who, in our 
            view, is under the influence of alcohol or drugs and/or is deemed 
            by the guide not to comply with our safety rules. The guide can disallow 
            any customer who is found unfit to continue with the tour at any point 
            during the tour.<br>
            <br>
            During the winter months our afternoon tour time may, if necessary, 
            be adjusted according to sunset.</span><br>
