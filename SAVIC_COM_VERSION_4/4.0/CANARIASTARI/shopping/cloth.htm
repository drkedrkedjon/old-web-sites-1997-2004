  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is logical way of thinking to follow. If somebody 
    on street is offering to you golden Rolex watch for some 5.000 PTAs, you suppose 
    to understand that it is not original watch. For that price 20 meters away 
    is available original Swatch or Omega.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side if you want &quot;that Rolex&quot;, 
    Bu it, but please understand that there is no 30 days money back guaranty, 
    or guaranty at all.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargain the price on south of island till the end 
    of vendor nerves. It is worth of time. Don't be polite with them. This is 
    not advice. It is your money. And don't bargain in Las Palmas. There is Europe 
    way of business making there.<br>
