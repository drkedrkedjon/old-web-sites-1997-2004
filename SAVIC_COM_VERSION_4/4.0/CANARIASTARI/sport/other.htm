  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you can, a part of biking, windsurfing, fishing 
    and golfing, also walk... This is not joke. Many tourist agencies organize 
    walking excursion up in mountains. They take you with bus and later return 
    in town. Very interesting!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also all kind of water activities that you can imagine: 
    sailing, surfing, waterscuters, boats, parachuting and so on... All that in 
    Puerto Rico. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tennis... and other ground sports... everywhere...<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of course you can play football, but you do that 
    at home, so why should not?<br>
