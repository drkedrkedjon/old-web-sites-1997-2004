        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no &quot;Duty Free Shopping&quot; on 
        Gran Canaria. It is trick from the past, but it doesn't change anything 
        for you. The prices are generally smaller than in Europe for some 10 - 
        30%. It is because taxes here are only 4.5% and not 15 - 17% like in the 
        rest of EEU.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well it suppose to be like this but it isn't. 
        You can still by box of cigarettes here in supermarket with tax for less 
        money than in free shop in airplane, with no tax at all. And you can't 
        take home more than one box of cigarettes shopped in local supermarket 
        which mean that local supermarket is treated as free shop.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are probably in search for cheap home electronic. 
        Anything they offer to you can be bargained for 30 - 50%. If salesman 
        offer to you super price of 80.000 PTAs for video camera you can by same 
        one with little bit of negotiating for 40 - 50.000 PTAs.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side check little bit source of product 
        and does it have guarantee.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is gold opportunity for shopping. Gold is 
        excellent quality and much cheaper than in EEU because it comes from Africa 
        and Asia directly without dealers. Specially I recommend 18 karats gold. 
        It have excellent price. You, in most places can't bargain to much, but 
        try anyway, you never know.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watches, perfumes, cosmetics... by what you want, 
        nobody ask you why, and they accept all cards and money.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for me second best thing if cloth and fashion. 
        If you leave tourist south and go in Las Palmas in some of shopping centers, 
        you can by cloth from well known designers for less money than some china 
        T-shirt at your home. And don't shop china T-shirt here because cost more 
        than same at your home. Why? I don't know, that's the way of things here.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best shopping here? Try to by car. Some models 
        here are almost 50% cheaper than in Europe. You can by new Volkswagen 
        polo for 13.000 German mark. You import car in Germany where you pay tax 
        and have few thousand mark for save.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need a mountain bike, it's the same story. Check 
        little bit around.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the cheapest is sun... </h3>
