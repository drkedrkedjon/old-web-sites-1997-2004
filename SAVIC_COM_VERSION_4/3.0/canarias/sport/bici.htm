        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent weather condition make this island small 
        paradise for mountain biking. You can ride all year around, and since 
        rain days a rare...<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A part of weather, possibility to ride bike on 
        so strange volcanic island, with fantastic landscapes is more than gift. 
        There is no natural scenery in Europe like this. And tracks where you 
        ride are wild and rocky.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can found all category tracks, for family 
        or for professional riders. You can clime up to top of island on 2000 
        meters.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally have make somewhere around 6000 kilometers 
        in one year. I clime top and bottom of island and will be happy to help 
        you if you plan to ride here, so send me <a href="mailto:sasa@maptel.es">E-mail</a>.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, I will launch site only dedicated to mountain 
        biking on Gran Canaria with maps, roads, equipment, possibility for rent 
        a bike, affordable accommodation and so on. Please bookmark this site 
        for future...<br>
